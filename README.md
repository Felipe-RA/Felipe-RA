I'm deeply connected to my alma mater and into all things software development. As a proud 🟣 VelezReyes+ Tech Fellow, I've gained a broad knowledge base across the software development spectrum. I specialize in data analysis and machine learning, but I'm always eager to employ whatever tools necessary to get the job done. Quality Assurance (QA) automation fascinates me, and I'm constantly pondering how to leverage my skills to enhance my corner of the world.

🌍 **Human-Focused** - I believe developers should always prioritize the human aspect in technology. It's not just about code; it's about making lives better.

📚 **Teaching** - Currently, I'm working with faculty professor [rramosp](https://github.com/rramosp) on this AI for Engineers and Scientists  [here](https://github.com/Felipe-RA/ai4eng.v1). 

💡 **Projects** - My project portfolio is a testament to my passion. From in-progress works to my brainchild [udeai_forest](https://github.com/Felipe-RA/udeai_forest), an AI project I'm eagerly working to deploy.
